The AI engineer successfully built a React/FastAPI/MongoDB Webhook Gateway Hub. Initial work involved resolving login issues and implementing user profile dark mode and local backup scheduling. Subsequently, numerous user requests were addressed: refining dark mode, creating a robust GitHub auto-update system (which required significant troubleshooting for usage: git [-v | --version] [-h | --help] [-C <path>] [-c <name>=<value>]
           [--exec-path[=<path>]] [--html-path] [--man-path] [--info-path]
           [-p | --paginate | -P | --no-pager] [--no-replace-objects] [--bare]
           [--git-dir=<path>] [--work-tree=<path>] [--namespace=<name>]
           [--super-prefix=<path>] [--config-env=<name>=<envvar>]
           <command> [<args>]

   bisect    Use binary search to find the commit that introduced a bug
   diff      Show changes between commits, commit and working tree, etc
   grep      Print lines matching a pattern
   log       Show commit logs
   show      Show various types of objects
   status    Show the working tree status

grow, mark and tweak your common history
   branch    List, create, or delete branches
   commit    Record changes to the repository
   merge     Join two or more development histories together
   rebase    Reapply commits on top of another base tip
   reset     Reset current HEAD to the specified state
   switch    Switch branches
   tag       Create, list, delete or verify a tag object signed with GPG

collaborate (see also: git help workflows)
   fetch     Download objects and refs from another repository
   pull      Fetch from and integrate with another repository or a local branch
   push      Update remote refs along with associated objects

Additional features included real IP logging, backup download/restore, log clearing, webhook replay, clickable activity logs, password change, and integrating SMTP2Go. The engineer was actively working on fixing issues with collapsed webhook cards, full payload display in logs, GitHub release detection, and detailed pull logs, with the trajectory ending mid-fix for the GitHub release API.

<product_requirements>
The user requires a self-hosted Webhook Gateway Hub, built with React, FastAPI, and MongoDB. Key features include secure authentication, user management (admin/standard roles), named webhook endpoints () with secret tokens and logging, SendGrid integration (API key management, contact lists, templates), a settings panel for managing various API keys (initially SendGrid, GitHub, Google Drive, Dropbox, later narrowed to exclude Google Drive/Dropbox and add SMTP2Go), a dashboard with request summaries and a log viewer. Further requirements include a GitHub Update Manager (pull/deploy), a Backup Manager (local/cloud backups), and security features like HTTPS and AES-encrypted secrets. The application needs  for Ubuntu 24.04 and Cloudflare Tunnel integration. Recent feature additions included SendGrid Lists and SendGrid Templates pages, clickable log entries for details, a local backup scheduler (daily/weekly), and a user profile page with a dark mode toggle and password change. The user also requested removal of Emergent branding, replay of failed webhooks, clickable recent activity, editable webhook endpoints, collapsible webhook cards (collapsed by default), download/restore for backups, clear logs, and enhanced GitHub auto-update with detailed version comparison and update logs.

<current_work>
The AI engineer is currently addressing several user requests focused on improving UI/UX and system feedback. Specifically, the work involves:
1.  **Webhooks Page**: Modifying  to ensure that webhook cards, which are now collapsible, are collapsed by default upon page load.
2.  **Logs Page**: Debugging and potentially adjusting  to correctly display the *full* webhook payload within the log entry details dialog, as the user reported it's still not showing completely.
3.  **Settings Page - Backups**: Updating  to integrate a download option for each scheduled backup listed, enabling users to easily retrieve backup files.
4.  **Settings Page - Updates**: Fixing functionality related to GitHub updates in  and . This includes ensuring that the latest GitHub release detection works reliably and that the pull process provides more detailed logging, specifically showing the location where the code is downloaded.

The trajectory concludes with the engineer in the process of fixing the backend logic in  for GitHub release detection, specifically to remove the requirement for a token.
